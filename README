Each file in this directory is a source file or a configuration file 
	for setting up adicional functionality into the shell environment 
	- see scripts section below for adicional information.

The shell scripts are intended to be sourced on bash or ksh shells, 
	and to provide an easy way to extend to other shells; e.g.: zsh.
They are expected to run on multiple Linux flavours; and have been tested 
	on Red Hat and Debian based systems.

	SHELL's:
		bash	GNU bash, version 4.4.19(1)-release (x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu)
		ksh		version sh (AT&T Research) 93u+ 2012-08-01


# ***************************************************************************
Install

These files are intended to run for setting an user's environment.

Copy dotfiles.d to your home directory and add the command below 
	to your ~/.<shell>rc file:

	[ -f ~/dotfiles.d/loadenv.sh ] && . ~/dotfiles.d/loadenv.sh

	e.g.:
	bash:	echo '[ -f ~/dotfiles.d/loadenv.sh ] && . ~/dotfiles.d/loadenv.sh' >> ~/.bashrc
	ksh:	echo '[ -f ~/dotfiles.d/loadenv.sh ] && . ~/dotfiles.d/loadenv.sh' >> ~/.kshrc


You can also do a system wide installation; in this case you will need 
	root or sudo permissions.
	
Edit loadenv.sh
	comment the line _source_dir=~/dotfiles
	uncomment the line #_source_dir=/etc/profile.d/dotfiles

Copy dotfiles.d to /etc/profile.d

Create a file in /etc/profile.d with '.sh' extension and
	copy the command below:

	if [ -f /etc/profile.d/dotfiles/loadenv.sh ]; then
		. /etc/profile.d/dotfiles/loadenv.sh
	fi
